# Live Wallpaper for MacOS

This is a open-source live wallpaper applicationn for MacOS 15+

Currently it doesn't have a Good looking UI, but it gets the work done ğŸ™‚


## Befor you run the programme
Pleas make a folde on your `$HOME` directory called `Livewall` and place some video files in it.

This application currently supported for `.mp4` and `.mov` extensions.

I hope to make user able to define video paths and file formats ğŸ™‚

## Installation
You can just download the binary from releases or compile this using cmake

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to bypass Gatekeeper for run this(I don't want to pay apple for opensource apps)
> 
> This will solve the Damage-File popup
> 
> `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/LiveWallpaper.app`
