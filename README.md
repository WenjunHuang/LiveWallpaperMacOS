This is a open-source live wallpaper applicationn for mac os.

Currently it doesn't have a Good looking UI, but it gets the work done ðŸ™‚


## Befor you run the programme
Pleas make a folde on your `$HOME` directory called `Livewall` and place some video files in it.

This application currently supported for `.mp4` and `.mov` extensions.
